## Overview

MapAnything is a simple, end-to-end trained transformer model that directly regresses the factored metric 3D geometry of a scene given various types of modalities as inputs. A single feed-forward model supports over 12 different 3D reconstruction tasks including multi-image sfm, multi-view stereo, monocular metric depth estimation, registration, depth completion and more.

This is the Apache 2.0 variant of the model. Latest release on Jan 20th 2026.
