# LTX-2.3 Model Card

This model card focuses on the LTX-2.3 model, which is a significant update to the [LTX-2 model](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-2) with improved audio and visual quality as well as enhanced prompt adherence.
LTX-2 was presented in the paper [LTX-2: Efficient Joint Audio-Visual Foundation Model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2601.03233).

💻💻 **If you want to dive in right to the code - it is available [here](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2).** 💾💾

LTX-2.3 is a DiT-based audio-video foundation model designed to generate synchronized video and audio within a single model. It brings together the core building blocks of modern video generation, with open weights and a focus on practical, local execution.

## Model Details
- **Developed by:** Lightricks
- **Model type:** Diffusion-based audio-video foundation model
- **Language(s):** English

# Online demo
LTX-2.3 is accessible right away via the [API Playground](https://console.ltx.video/playground/).

# Run locally

## Direct use license
You can use the models - full, distilled, upscalers and any derivatives of the models - for purposes under the [license](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/LICENSE-2_x).

## ComfyUI
We recommend you use the built-in LTXVideo nodes that can be found in the ComfyUI Manager. 
For manual installation information, please refer to our [documentation site](https://docs.ltx.video/open-source-model/integration-tools/comfy-ui).

## PyTorch codebase

The [LTX-2 codebase](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2) is a monorepo with several packages. From model definition in 'ltx-core' to pipelines in 'ltx-pipelines' and training capabilities in 'ltx-trainer'.
The codebase was tested with Python >=3.12, CUDA version >12.7, and supports PyTorch ~= 2.7.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2.git
cd LTX-2

# From the repository root
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Inference

To use our model, please follow the instructions in our [ltx-pipelines](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/packages/ltx-pipelines/README.md) package.

## Diffusers 🧨

LTX-2.3 support in the [Diffusers Python library](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/index) is coming soon!

## General tips:
* Width & height settings must be divisible by 32. Frame count must be divisible by 8 + 1. 
* In case the resolution or number of frames are not divisible by 32 or 8 + 1, the input should be padded with -1 and then cropped to the desired resolution and number of frames.
* For tips on writing effective prompts, please visit our [Prompting guide](https://ltx.video/blog/how-to-prompt-for-ltx-2) 

### Limitations
- This model is not intended or able to provide factual information.
- As a statistical model this checkpoint might amplify existing societal biases.
- The model may fail to generate videos that matches the prompts perfectly.
- Prompt following is heavily influenced by the prompting-style.
- The model may generate content that is inappropriate or offensive.
- When generating audio without speech, the audio may be of lower quality.

# Train the model

The base (dev) model is fully trainable.

It's extremely easy to reproduce the LoRAs and IC-LoRAs we publish with the model by following the instructions on the [LTX-2 Trainer Readme](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-2/blob/main/packages/ltx-trainer/README.md).

Training for motion, style or likeness (sound+appearance) can take less than an hour in many settings.
